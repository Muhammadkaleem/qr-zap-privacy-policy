          Your privacy is important to us. Please read this privacy policy
          carefully.

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to QR Zap! We value your privacy and are committed to
          protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy outlines the
          permissions we request, how we handle the data, and how ads are served
          in the app.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Permissions We Request</h2>
        <p>Our application requires the following permissions to function:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Camera</strong> – To scan QR codes.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Write External Storage</strong> – To save QR code images in
            your gallery.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Read External Storage</strong> – To read stored QR code
            images.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Read Media Images</strong> – To access images for scanning
            QR codes from your device.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Read Contacts</strong> – This permission is required if a QR
            code contains contact information (like a phone number, email, or
            name). The app uses this permission to read the contact details so
            that you can choose to save them directly to your device's contacts
            list.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Write Contacts</strong> – This permission allows the app to
            add or modify contact details on your device. If a QR code contains
            contact information, the app will request this permission to add or
            update the contact in your device's contacts database.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. What Data We Collect</h2>
        <p>
          We do not collect any personal information apart from the permissions
          mentioned above. These permissions are solely used for scanning and
          saving QR codes. No personal data is stored or shared with third
          parties.
        </p>

        <h2>4. How We Use Your Data</h2>
        <p>
          We use the data solely for the purpose of creating and scanning QR
          codes within the app. Any data related to QR codes, such as images, is
          stored locally on your device and not transmitted to any servers or
          third parties.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Ads in the App</h2>
        <p>
          Our app uses third-party advertising services (such as Google AdMob)
          to display ads. These services may collect certain information to
          provide personalized ads. Below is how ads work in the app:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Ad Providers</strong> – We use third-party ad networks like
            Google AdMob to serve ads in the app. These networks may collect
            information such as your device's advertising identifier, IP
            address, and usage data to deliver relevant ads.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ad Tracking</strong> – Ad providers may use cookies, device
            identifiers, or other tracking technologies to collect data for
            ad-targeting purposes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Opt-Out of Personalized Ads</strong> – You can opt-out of
            personalized ads by adjusting your device's advertising settings.
            For example, on Android, you can go to
            <strong>Settings > Google > Ads</strong> and enable "Opt out of Ads
            Personalization."
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
          Your QR code images and other data are stored locally and are retained
          until you choose to delete them from your device. Ad providers may
          retain data as per their own privacy policies.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
          We use third-party services, such as Google AdMob, to display ads in
          the app. These services may collect data for ad personalization and
          analytics. We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of these
          third-party services to understand how they handle your data:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank"
              >Google Privacy Policy</a
            >
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Your Privacy Rights</h2>
        <p>
          You have the right to deny any permissions requested by the app. If
          you choose to deny certain permissions, please note that the app’s
          functionality may be limited. Additionally, you can opt-out of
          personalized ads through your device settings.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will
          be posted on this page, and the updated policy will be effective
          immediately upon publication.
        </p>
