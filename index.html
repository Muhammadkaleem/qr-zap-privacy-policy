        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to QR Zap! We value your privacy and are committed to
          protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy outlines the
          permissions we request and how we handle the data.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Permissions We Request</h2>
        <p>Our application requires the following permissions to function:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Camera</strong> – To scan QR codes.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Write External Storage</strong> – To save QR code images in
            your gallery.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Read External Storage</strong> – To read stored QR code
            images.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Read Media Images</strong> – To access images for scanning
            QR codes from your device.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Read Contacts</strong> – This permission is required if a QR code contains contact information (like a phone number, email, or name). The app uses this permission to read the contact details so that you can choose to save them directly to your device's contacts list.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Write Contacts</strong> – This permission allows the app to add or modify contact details on your device. If a QR code contains contact information, the app will request this permission to add or update the contact in your device's contacts database.

        </ul>

        <h2>3. What Data We Collect</h2>

        <h2>4. How We Use Your Data</h2>
        <p>
          We use the data solely for the purpose of creating and scanning QR
          codes within the app. Any data related to QR codes, such as images, is
          stored locally on your device and not transmitted to any servers or
          third parties.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
          Your QR code images and other data are stored locally and are retained
          until you choose to delete them from your device.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
          We do not use any third-party services that collect, store, or share
          your personal information.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Your Privacy Rights</h2>

          You have the right to deny any permissions requested by the app. If
          you choose to deny certain permissions, please note that the app’s
          functionality may be limited.
        </p>
